### 1.Introduction
Team project to create a web application in C#. The design of individual views can be seen in the file docs/wireframe.pdf, where we can see views for teacher, 
student, and admin. Furthermore, in the docs folder, there are files containing the ER diagrams of our application. In the InformationSystem folder, 
we can see the project solution, with subfolders such as InformationSystem.DAL containing the DBcontext solution, Entities, Mappers, and Repositories. 
In the InformationSystem.DAL.Tests folder, there are tests for DBcontext and tests for individual entities. 
Additionally, InformationSystem.Common.Tests can be found here, which test the application as a whole.
